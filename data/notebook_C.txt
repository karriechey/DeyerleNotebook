2nd: Morland, crystal H6; 24.7 gm. particle. Bought from Beltony Showcase, across lobby, 6/15/1944. $209.95. Oval.

Crystal. Probably by Glenn Hansen or myself. "Hope"

Bz. Index: 3.7, Bz 4 degrees or so. Tilt c. 8-10.

A dull, gem-material, gray. Much like several Mexican Crystals. Clear areas in many of the latter.

Hunan crust is dull - a material. Gold on top, with dull green at bottom, in streaks.

Crystal cube is dull - a material. Dark brown-reddish, metallic, pitted, and rough.

This area is somewhat recessed. On the top, 2 edges resemble each other, but differ in width and curve. The Mat cube edge is matched exactly to a wide section of the crystal.

The Mat. cube itself resembles the x-tal edge. Reddish-brown at the bottom. A fairly large area is somewhat rough and appears undeveloped. To match edges of the cube to crystal seems impossible.

A dull, dark edge at the bottom. Spotting of what paint? (more common)

30c Rochechouart [ Chassenon? ], France impact breccias slices - 5 different types of specimens - from different levels across - see the map in my notes (crater is ≈ 28.5km).

=== **Page: 30 of 34**

B. M. - Fe-CR-Ni metallic residues have been found in rocks in the crater floor.

Eroded almost entirely away. The breccias display a wide range of colors - yellow & red & browns. Bolygo in.

(a) Balaude, France - 13.9 gm., $69.50, Rectangular-polished. 145 mm X 33 mm X 4-5 mm. Appears thin at one edge. A swirly pattern - light grey to a light grey, predominantly. With a pink tint to just hue. Some pits, to a cavity along 1 long edge & an open chip at a corner. 1 or 2 other more white areas are probably where past incl.

(b) Came out during polishing. Rochechouart, France - 13.7 gm., $68.50, Shaped "top" 50-50 mm X 35 (widest end) - < 5 mm. 23 (narrow end) X 6+ - < 5 mm [it's thinner along 1 long edge]. Top & bottom are cut & roughly polished. The "top" has medium grayish matrix. Many tiny curved projections, also medium grayish matrix. Cavities. The "bottom" is similar, but has an apparent late matte finish. All the edges are natural. From the projection, on its tip, along that long edge a darker, into the adjoining edge, is an outset surface - gan, dark red brown. The other surface appears broken. Interior surface - dark resembles the main color.

(c) Montrésor, France - 12.9 gm., $64.50, Shaped 55 mm X 45 (wide and) - 25 (narrow end) X > 5-< 5 mm [it's thinner along 1 long edge]. The top & bottom are cut & both roughly polished. Both are predominately medium light tan-gray, but switching to predominantly dark gray along its narrow 1/2. Call in a purplish hue. Along the wider 1/2 the red is the more predominant. Both sides of the narrow 1/2 gan. needs a little dark grey (on the one upper outset surface - gan. needs it darker and greyer (on its tip). The and long edge, gan. needs to very dark, may be a to very dark, may be a broken interior sample.

(d) La Valette, France - 11.7 gm., $58.50. Shaped 45 mm (at longest point) X 35 mm (at widest point) X 7-8 mm. The top & bottom are cut & both roughly polished. The "top" is golden tan - beige, in shades which 57 towards Glas & a number of cavities.

The edges are ranked - they are raised at top & bottom. appears like the top & bottom are cut & as ball roughly polished. The "top" is dull dark gray, again pitted, has some small white lines. a couple edges weaked - appear rolled or some small & very long dark lines. several lines on the "bottom" & similar & a # cavities to vesicles. resembled - opening area & a cavity each of non vesicles.

(9) Cassagnes (France) (At name given to the Crater in the B.M. Catalog) - 14.1gm., $70.50. X Shaped (as next print) X 10 MM. The top & bottom are cut & as Ball roughly polished.

31c Sudbury, Ontario, Canada Shattercone: small specimen. Bought by Bethany Frances, 1/13/97, $4.9, B.M. - Ni-Sulphide ores this may be meteorite. "A ridged Cone-Sloped neck fragment" roughly triangular - a "shark tooth." ~ 3" (base) X 3" (longest point) X ¾-7/8+" (Weight unknown. A projection stick out at 1 Corner of the base & it sticks up along its top & continues ~ ¾ of the top & the bottom the projection opens, where is rounded. On the bottom the surrounding area is the lowest point - the rest of the surrounding area rises towards the open. The top is very dark dull gray, pitted, hollowed (as if eaten). I can not label dirt (clay gray). The bottom is darker, more of the asphalt shade. Down some of the edges is blackish to very little dirt. The only chips are at the interface in the bottom. The opp. long edge is similar - on roll/cannon head along the projection & subsiding. One remains on

The projection near to base? The base is blackish, has a number of cavities, some small whitish chips. Call of the whitish "dirt" on the specimen may be chips. 2-3 more serious chips, exposing the dark dull brown, entrances of the stone. One of these extends into the bottom, where it expands - it's a little (<1mm) air/interstice in/with the bottom, < 1/2 layer, brownish chip.

32c  Lappajarvi, Finland karnatite impact breccia: 27 gm. Still, brought to Bethany Sciences 11/13/97 $135. B.M. - Impact melt rocks from here contain Fe-Ni metal, possibly a Carbonaceous Chondrite. Less features indicating it had been melted at some time in its past. Karpatite can be found in most of the crater structure, shaped as 80 mm X 40 mm. Crushed point? X < 5 mm. Cut & pressed. Both top & bottom < 25% are visibly polished. The 4 edges motion are diff. shades of medium light grey, possibly arranged in flow lines. Numerous dark brownish spots, less prob. a distinct layer of a diff. ch. along the natural edges, also in lines. The bottom has relatively small nice. Not very big pittes. The distinct edge layer is considerably bigger than the top, appx 1 cm. It is more rooted in dark, like the appears grooved! Pres. pittes. The short cut edge had 1/3 yr. - towards the bottom, the "lines" part - The short cut edge had 2 grey bands. The long cut edge is recessed - a little dome/crown as the long cut edge had. It's rough, dull, greyish, in such "terraces" it is similar. The outside edges appear to be other surfaces - gen. a dull greyish brown. Thin shell, and "o" (circle) of various clos. It degrades into all the distinct layers mentioned earlier, esp. on the bottom, where many of the clos are similar. media grooved? proto. medium set.
