Large Krasnoyarsk (0-> face)

07 Descriptions of 8 Estherville, Iowa meteorites:

(a) A 1.3 gm crust fragment; weathered black crust on one side; rusty brown on the opposite side. Thin, in a plastic box. (stn)

(b) A 1.8 gm metal piece; dark crust matrix; inclusions of pyroxene and particles around some small metal inclusions in opposite sides of the matrix. Really only 2 edges opposite each other. 

Both edges have greenish ting), 2 oppositely. Some attached to one side = oppositely to the other. One side has rust + attached. The rust is a separate tiny thin separate crust -> OK. But also rust is incorporated into the crust (stn)

(c) A 3.8 gm part slice. The cut face on dull. Lots of little metal inclusions. The metal is little like mercury on edges on ragged, uncut interior surface. Green on outside surface. Taken at the toe. Visible specimen is wide at least 4 times. The specimen is widest at 4th (a long side). Known because it shows some rusty metal. "Stone"

(d) A 0.5 gm "antenna" and slice; no by metal inclusions; i.e. "holes". Then - has basically just 2 sides rising & meet in a "bulb shape" to top. The sides are rust + top are rust + "crystal" thin edges. The thin edges between the sides. The sides are uncut interior surface. Sizes "antenna" because it is spindly, dark rust. (Face)

(e) A 13.0 gm part slice. Top = lots of little metal inclusions with little pots long dimension in cut; sitting in a ragged, interior surface. Seen on a crust face. A few spindly metal inclusions. Base = texture may be laminated. Most crust face, next on a ragged at the bottom level.

The middle sized one is brightly fld. - "top" has some dark, sparkly inclusions. May be greener than the other already labeled. The "bottom" is rustler, blotchy & few inclusions. Thin - not solid. The one common (lighter on then the top).

The largest one is also flattish. Both sides are the same color (lighter on the top?). The middle sized one. The side shows a little rustler, do by did sparkly inclusion, "It" side by + to a point, (-) is just a rustler, pointed as / and \ combo'd as the 1st (it wedge). 1 edge is 8 liters; the stain is rustler.
