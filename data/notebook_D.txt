340 H3,6 - Willard (B), New Mexico: 17.3gm.  
port slice - Bought fr. Bethany Sciences, 1/13/97, $346.  
Not in B.M. Cat. - not published yet. Contains triangular Carbonaceous (CM2?) Incl. Seen to fall in 1933 (?). Met. No. ? 22826, recovered in 1934 - recovered in 1995, Revista.

My specimen contains at least 2 carbonaceous incl. ~ 1 large one ~ 2 x 5 mm. Roughly triangular, 1 long edge + 2 shorter edges meeting at a point opp. the center of its base. This "tip" is partially cut (~ 30% of the face) on the left side of the base, is textured + rises (~ 1 mm) above the cut surface. The material top half has a central indentation & is itself triangular. It's open to weathering outside surf. is dark red rusty brown + even, but round or dome "dusted". A Carb. incl. is visible along the base edge ~ 2/3 of the way to point I. The cut part is only a little roughly polished (if at all) - the incl. stone cuts more easily than weathered - a dull grey compared to del. staining to brownish in fl. patches. The lg. incl. Rusty veins/Cracks to a few spots. The lg. incl. is thin in this area. The Cut bottom is similar - shows growing -> at least 1 now weathered. No open. Carb. incl. seen here. (as seen fr. the top.) The bottom is retained + this section is mostly an undisturbed lrg. incl. which reaches to ~ 40% dull dark red rusty brown lg. incl. hang -> open on its weathered outside surf., Partially overlain by Lydite" Calcite?" poss. Carb. (dark incl.) The base edge appears to be on the weathered surf. - it's dull and grey - down & mostly covered w/ Calcite & rust clrs. or dust.

The thin edge, entirely along the Cut surface is similar. The short edge that's partially only ~ curved point ? The tip is similar - the dull grey shows - crust on ? Stone. Open. 

Open area x it contain - dirty yellowish, + other gas.

Other Carb. incl. here? The Lg. Carb. incl. has several cracks running through it. 1/x may be tiny pits.  
PROBABLY - Ron F. - Sebold matl. and big ball - NASA wanted this specimen

The ~70% of the face "right" of the 2nd keel is slightly concave - it ends at a straight edge. This edge runs vertically (w/ a slight concavity) to the end of the top keel. [Near the bottom the taper stops, beyond the top keel the face drops vertically to the bottom]. Beyond the top keel, its a straight edge merges w/ a roundish edge; still fairly straight - slightly convex projecting out length in a concavity or lip, esp. near the bottom. The final, larger edge, tapers down from the top keel to the bottom & ends at the pointed end of

The Top is smaller than the bottom. 2 of the rounded edges taper down, a round area of "Caliche." Some. This specimen has dark rusty red brown to blackish oxide crust - unclear if any "real crust" left. ~22 X 15 X 4-5 mm. ② A smaller, shirt-shaped specimen. Really no edges - the 2 sides taper together, or meet at very thin interfaces. Appears oriental. The front is convex smooth black crust w/some reddish brown mist or clay. Contraction/blow lines. The back is convex a rough surface, divided in 2 by a ridge, almost entirely covered w/clay/caliche. Some blackish areas a little rust. Prominent flow (?) lines, some across the edges. ~23 X 11 MM. The thickness varies greatly. ③ A slightly smaller forty-shaped one. Likely oriented. The front gen. resembles that of ②. It tapers to the bottom along its long axis -> only 2 sides/plan. The top is short axis. The edge at the "root" is mostly concave, indented. Rough, esp. around the edges. Mostly covered w/clay or rust - dome like but a steeper curve - some blackish areas. The opposite edge is undercut - it's below the front at the tip. The "front" side is blackish, but mostly covered by clay + caliche - these areas are roughish, slightly concave. The bottom is flattish - slightly concave - dull blackish in the center. Thick (on back) caliche around this central area. Rust/clay at 1 edge; beside this is an area of fairly shiny metal, 20 X 15 mm. The thickness varies. ④ A piece that resembles

Dull black crust. Lies, but largely covered by clay / caliche. The edge is undercut - it's largely composed of large concavity. <2 small ones. Some shiny black crust & some dull, no prominent lines. A fair amount of rust / clay / caliche. Black The back w/ a partial ridge. It has black crust - some smooth; some w/ prominent lines - most of it is shiny. The face is ~ 1/2 covered w/ clay / rust / caliche. ~ 19 X 18 or 19 X 8-9 mm.  
5 A very small specimen - roughly rectangular. It appears oriented. The front is convex & rounded - dull block rusty crust w/ lines. Because of the rounding, the edges are arguably extensions of the front. The 2 short ones, opposite each other, are ? vertical. The shortest one has smooth, shiny block crust, mostly covered w/ rust / clay / caliche. The opposite one is smooth shiny block crust w/ little clay or rust. The longest edge tapers down to the back - fairly shiny smooth block crust. 2/3 of it is cemented to the caliche etc. The smoothness of the top is partially interrupted by a concavity. The opposite edge is vertical. Somewhat shiny, fairly smooth block crust mostly covered by clay etc. The back / bottom is concave w/ a rounded projection along 1 edge. The projection is the smooth black crust. The rest of opposite edge have fairly shiny, smooth black crust. The fore shows a little crest, but is mostly clay / rust / caliche. = 13 X 7 X 11 X 10 mm around the 4 edges. Averages ~ 5 mm thick.  
6 A thin piece, but easily the longest of the ten. 1 long edge is straight, 2-3 mm thick along about 1/2 its length; the rest is thinner. The thick part has ragged, dull block crust on much clay, etc. The thin part has smooth, shiny crust w/ much of the clay. The short edge adjoining is basically a smooth projection. A smaller, rough projection separated by an indentation - shiny black crust on the end of the longer projection; otherwise the clay, etc. The thickness varies - 3 mm & less. The 2nd long edge is a large central concavity w/ large rounded projections at the ends, 1 of these has its own fairly large concave area. The concavities are gen. dull, ragged block, rust & some of the coating. Otherwise, the edge is gen. coated. The thickness greatly varies. The 4th edge, a short one, is gently rounded - convex.

I dull smoothest area of Crust - otherwise the Caliche, set. ≈ 2- to 3+ mm thick. The top is gently convex. A complex mixture of dull rough black crust & the various coatings, somewhat weathered looking. The bottom is flattish along a short edge, apart the adjoining long ones. Otherwise, it's largely a large relatively shallow concavity & several small deep ones. The complex mixture again, some of the crust is shiny & smooth. The rest of the face appears weathered. .35X18 to 20 MM. ⑦ A piece roughly the size ⑦ ⑧ ⑨, roughly thin. The top is composed basically of 3 very small projections, all? 120° apart. 1 tapers up, 1 tapers down, & 1 is horizontal. That projection is mostly smooth dull black crust & the rust, etc. The one tapering rep is rust/clay/some caliche. The one going down is mostly Caliche & clay, no edges along this projection, it meets the bottom. At the end of the horizon is a small undercut edge - it resembles that projection. Between the horiz. projection & the 1 going up the only edge is id small concavities - & clay filled. He has more crust, some fairly shiny metal. At the end of the projection tapering up is a small edge - mostly caliche covered. The top has several small spots where more metal shows. The bottom is flattish corner - Covered w/ caliche, etc. The rest of the face is several concavities separated by ridges. Mostly covered w/ clay etc. Some Crust or even bare metal on the ridges. .220 X 22 mm The thickness varies greatly. ⑧ An oblong specimen - the end opposite of the iron, Possibly oriented. The top is convex - rounded. Divided into 2 facets by a gentle ridge along along this. Fairly shiny black crust - Some smooth, some w/ the lines - but mostly covered w/ crust & clay. Only 2 edges because of tapering. An undercut at a narrow end - ≈ ½ a fairly shiny, mostly smooth black crust, the rest clay/rust. A 2nd edge along part of the long ones - it is very similar to a little caliche. The back?/bottom is a member of hourly shallow concavities. Again, ≈ ½ clay/rust & ½ fairly shiny black crust, mostly smooth, domain the lines. .28 X 15 X up to 7 mm thick. ⑨ An individual the size of ② ③ ④. Possibly, oriental. Only 4 faces. The bottom is flattish - fairly shiny black crust on the lines. Much clay/caliche/rust. Only 1 edge, divided into 2 very shallow concavities. Slightly undercut smoothish block crust there.
